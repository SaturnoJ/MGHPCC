If a search finished we might want to cleanup the results. For example, all the philosopher workspaces can take up some space.

Next, we zip the complete results folder.
Then we extract the .csv and .tsv files.
Then we delete.

Now we just have one ZIP and the results file instead of thousands of little files.
